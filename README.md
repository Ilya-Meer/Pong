# Pong Game

A basic pong game.

## Synopsis

This game was created by using Javascript to generate SVGS.

### Learnings

A major learning objective in this project was based around Javascript classes. The playing field, board, paddles,balls, and scoreboard are all classes of their own that are imported into an overarching Game class which is then rendered continuously. 

## Setup
